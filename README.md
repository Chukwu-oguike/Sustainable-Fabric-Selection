Sustainability in the textile and fashion industry has become increasingly important as apparel and footwear consumption increases
on a global scale. However, there are many challenges that face an engineer or designerattempting to improve their companyâ€™s carbon foot print. 
There is little research on different materials and their environmental impact, and all relevant work that has been done
in this area is primarily consulted retroactively, to assess the degree to which a product is "eco-friendly" for marketing purposes.
The goal of this project is to offer a proactive, proof-of-concept solution to this problem; to guide those in this field with suggestions on
more sustainable materials and fibers to use in their projects. Thus, a tool was developed that relies on the mechanical properties
and environmental impact attributes of 23 different materials. Data science techniques including K-means clustering and Principal
Component Analysis were harnessed in order to recommend functionally similar, yet more sustainable alternatives to the material
provided by the user. The project culminated in this tool being available on a password-protected public domain, with the hopes that
some designers, engineers, and corporations can leverage insights to minimize their environmental burden.
